I`ve tried so many times... but nothing. It seems not to be working with my Visual Studio 2015RC
Thats why i installed Visual Studio 2013 Community. This is working algorith navigating through the
installation process!!!!


1. Download "ODAC" with Oracle Developer Tools for Visual Studio.   32bit version!!!

2. In C:\oraclexe\app\oracle\product\11.2.0\server\network\ADMIN  -    oracle  server working directory
	Open file tnsnames.ora
This is first rows:

XE =
  (DESCRIPTION =
    (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = RADKO-LAPTOP)(PORT = 1521))
    (CONNECT_DATA =
      (SERVER = DEDICATED)
      (SERVICE_NAME = XE)
    )
  )

(ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = RADKO-LAPTOP)(PORT = 1521))  !!!Mandatory
Where the host is the name of the computer.
Sevice_name = XE    !!!Mandatory

	3.7 Connection Alias : This is alias, schema name in oracle. In my case "TeamWork"
		Port Number: 1521
		Database Host Name: The name of the computer. In my case "RADKO-LAPTOP".

4. Steps in Visual Studio 2013.
	4.1 View -> Server Explorer
	4.2 Tools -> Connect to Database
	In Add Connection window:
		1.Data Source:  Oracle Database(ODP.NET,Managed Driver)
		2.Username and Password :  This is the username(oracle schema name) and pass of the my oracle database. 
			In my case "teamwork", "teamwork". I created this username and pass with the script file in Problem 1.
		3.Connect as SYSDBA role - default
		4.Connection type - default
		5.Data source name: If everything is OK  i will be able to check my Oracle DB alias. 
			In my case "TeamWork".
		6.Tnsnames.ora : Here i have the path to the tnsnames.ora - leave it by default
		7.Connection name - default

And ...... voila there you have it. The priceless connection is there. Finally!

In every solution that we create and use oracle connection we have to install  from NuGet Package Manager Console :
	1. Install-Package Oracle.ManagedDataAccess
	2. Install-Package Oracle.ManagedDataAccess.EntityFramework
